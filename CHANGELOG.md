### Bug fixes

* `EditableElement` should be recognized in the View node inspector. Closes [#49](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-inspector/issues/49). ([729a922](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-inspector/commit/729a922))

### BREAKING CHANGES

* The `CKEditorInspector.attach( 'editor-name', editor );` syntax was deprecated and replaced by an object literal `CKEditorInspector.attach( { 'editor-name': editor, ... } );`.

  **Note**: The old syntax works (backward compatibility) but it produces a warning in the console and will be removed in the future. We highly recommend using the new `attach()` method syntax ([learn more](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-inspector/blob/master/README.md#quick-start)).
