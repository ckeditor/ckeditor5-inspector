## Documentation ðŸ“–

Learn how to use the inspector and see it live in the [Development tools](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/development-tools.html) guide.

## Quick start

Include the script to load the inspector:

```html
<script src="path/to/inspector.js"></script>
```

Call `CKEditorInspector.attach( editor )` when the editor instance is ready:

```js
ClassicEditor
	.create( ... )
	.then( editor => {
		CKEditorInspector.attach( editor );
	} )
	.catch( error => {
		console.error( error );
	} );
```

**Note**: You can attach to multiple editors under unique names at a time. Then you can select the editor instance in the dropâ€“down inside the inspector panel to switch context.

```js
CKEditorInspector.attach( {
	'header-editor': editor1,
	'footer-editor': editor2,
	// ...
} );
```

Call `CKEditorInspector.detach( name )` to detach the inspector from an editor instance.

**Tip**: `CKEditorInspector.attach()` returns the generated name of the editor if it was not provided.

```js
// Attach the inspector to two editor instances:
const generatedName = CKEditorInspector.attach( editor1 );
CKEditorInspector.attach( { arbitraryName: editor2 } );

// ...

// Detach from the instances:
CKEditorInspector.detach( generatedName );
CKEditorInspector.detach( 'arbitraryName' );
```

### Attaching to all editor instances

When multiple CKEditor 5 instances are running in DOM, you can call `CKEditorInspector.attachToAll( [ options ] )` to attach the inspector to all of them at the same time. A shorthand for `CKEditorInspector.attach( editor, [ options ] )` called individually for each instance.

```js
// Discover all editor instances in DOM and inspect them all.
CKEditorInspector.attachToAll();
```

You can also pass the optional [configuration object](#configuration) to this method.

**Note**: This method works with CKEditor v12.3.0 or later. Earlier editor versions will not be discovered.

### Toggling the inspector visibility

Click the button in the upper-right corner of the inspector to quickly show or hide it. You can also use the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd> (<kbd>âŒ¥</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd> on Mac) keyboard shortcut.

### Configuration

You can pass configuration options to `CKEditorInspector.attach()` and `CKEditorInspector.attachToAll()` methods as the last argument:

```js
CKEditorInspector.attach( editor, {
	// configuration options
} );

CKEditorInspector.attach( { 'editor-name': editor }, {
	// configuration options
} );

CKEditorInspector.attachToAll( {
	// configuration options
} );
```

#### `isCollapsed`

To attach the inspector with a collapsed UI, use the `options.isCollapsed` option.

**Note**: This option works when `CKEditorInspector.attach()` is called for the first time only.

```js
CKEditorInspector.attach( { 'editor-name': editor }, {
	// Attach the inspector to the "editor" but the UI will be collapsed.
	isCollapsed: true
} );
```

## Development

To configure the environment:

```console
git clone git@github.com:ckeditor/ckeditor5-inspector.git
cd ckeditor5-inspector
yarn install
```

### Working with the code

Start the webpack file watcher:

```console
yarn dev
```

and open `http://path/to/ckeditor5-inspector/sample/inspector.html` in your web browser.

### Building

To build the production version of the inspector, run:

```console
yarn build
```

### Testing

To run tests, execute:

```console
yarn test
```

## Releasing the package

CircleCI automates the release process and can release both channels: stable (`X.Y.Z`) and pre-releases (`X.Y.Z-alpha.X`, etc.).

Before you start, you need to prepare the changelog entries.

1. Make sure the `#master` branch is up-to-date: `git fetch && git checkout master && git pull`.
1. Prepare a release branch: `git checkout -b release-[YYYYMMDD]` where `YYYYMMDD` is the current day.
1. Generate the changelog entries: `yarn run release:prepare-changelog`.
	* You can specify the release date by passing the `--date` option, e.g., `--date=2025-06-11`.
	* By passing the `--dry-run` option, you can check what the script will do without actually modifying the files.
	* Read all the entries, correct poor wording and other issues, wrap code names in backticks to format them, etc.
	* Add the missingÂ `the/a` articles,Â `()`Â to method names, "it's" -> "its", etc.
	* A newly introduced feature should have just one changelog entry â€“ something like "The initial implementation of the FOO feature." with a description of what it does.
1. Commit all changes and prepare a new pull request targeting the `#master` branch.
1. Ping the `@ckeditor/ckeditor-5-platform` team to review the pull request and trigger the release process.
